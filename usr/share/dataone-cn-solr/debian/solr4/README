Solr 4 configuration README

Using core discovery feature of solr 4.  Just need to create 2 directories for the cores ('search_core', 'log_core') and
place appropriate core.properties file inside each.  Then copy appropriate schema.xml and solrconfig.xml file into the 'conf'
directory inside each core dir.

Currently security filters are working but without corresponding request handlers, they do not do anything.
So security has been hardcoded for search and log.
For search - isPublic:true is hardcoded
For log - faceting without results is hardcoded.


Applies when security is working:
Update solrconfig for search and log to use custom request handlers for query engine descriptions and custom request handler
for search (/select).

Update /var/lib/jetty/context/solr-jetty-context.xml to use 'descriptor' setting: 
web.xml is a copy of the default solr 4 web.xml file.  According to jetty doc, web-override.xml should be able to define
additions to default web.xml contained in the solr.war /WEB-INF/web.xml file, but this override feature does not appear
to work in practive.  Consequently a full copy of web.xml has been created with DataONE Session Authentication filters defined.
Ideally these should just be defined in the web-override.xml file as a web.xml formated snippet.
